INTRODUCTION                                            *selectbycolor*

selectbycolor.vim is a simple plugin that provides visual selection and
operator objects to select lines of text by their color.


TEXT OBJECTS                                            *selectbycolor-text-objects*

The following text objects are provided:

                                                        *ic* *v_ic*
ic                      "inner color", select lines of text with the same
                        color as the character under the cursor. The relevant
                        character for each line is the character in the same
                        column as the cursor.

                                                        *oc* *v_oc*
oc                      "outer color", select lines of text with the same
                        color as the character under the cursor plus one
                        additional line at the start and end. The relevant
                        character for each line is the character in the same
                        column as the cursor.
